#How the project went\
Overall it was fine, pretty fun project honestly. Was able to learn a lot about react, apis, and ui libraries.
The part that gave me the most headache was the apis, since initially i wasn't that familiar with why we had to
make an endpoint in the backend to fetch data from an api(or database). Only after I encountered the CORS policy
blockage and the table only displaying when i set up a proxy server did I understand why. Throughout the project,
I tried pacing myself, getting at least 1 component done per day, with the functionality down before I went onto
the UI and how it looked. 
Also, the UI library was a godsend. Even though it's my first time using a ui library, I can just tweak their 
code a bit to display what I wanted my app to look like.
