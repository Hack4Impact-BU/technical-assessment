This was my very first React Project and i'm very new to all these concepts. I spent alot of time researching and teaching myself how React works and what i can use it for. I was able to find a React UI Libary that allowed me create componenets very easily and i was able to create the project through a bunch of research. This was a very good learning experience and i have encountered various problems and errors that i had no idea what they meant since i'm new to this framework and language but i learned a great deal. I had my code not able to fetch data because of the CORS restriction so i had to use a proxy server and learned how to implement it and add it. Overall this was such a huge learning experience for me and i feel more confident on my abilities. I hope to grow from here as i learn more how everything works and hopefully create more projects throughout the summer.
