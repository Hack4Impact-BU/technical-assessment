# Submission and Recording

This project was really interesting, as I was able to apply a lot of things I had learned about React into a project. I was able to combine what I have learned in the workshops and what I've been taking the time to self-learn outside of class. There were some minor challenges I encountered along the way, such as setting up the backend. Unfortunately, it was because I didn't have the time to go through the documentation to set this up, but I ended up with an interface that I am pretty proud of!

# technical-assessment

By <b>March 27th</b> you must fork this repository and submit a PR (pull request) to this repository with your completed version of the app.

## Summary

Create an app that acts as a news directory, filtering by state and lccn. You will do this using the api listed below and creating an interesting UI to navigate the results of the API with. Similar to this:

<img src="https://www.codehim.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Filter-Table-with-Select-Option-in-JavaScript.png" alt="table" width="1000px"/> <br/>
<b>This was from a seperate project so the info in your table will be different</b>

It will also have a section at the bottom for users to put their emails into to join your mailing list. You should display those emails on a seperate page in a table titled "Community". You can an example of what that looks like here:

<img src='./demo-ss/Community-page-demo.png' alt="Community Page" width="1000px"/> <br/>
<b>This was from a seperate project so the info in your table will be different</b>

## Requirements

- Use a JS framework
  - If using React don't use "create-react-app" because it is deprecated
- Use a UI library (it will make it much easier on you)
- Query the Library of Congress [api endpoint](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers.json) and display the results in a table
  - allow the user to filter by state and by lccn (this can be dropdowns seperate from the table)
- Have a backend to store your community members and read from it

## LLM Usage

Using LLMs for code assistance is allowed but you WILL be asked questions about your code in the interview (if invited) so you should be very comfortable with the purpose of the code.

## Submission

In order for your code to be assessed you must submit a PR by March 27th with the following

- runnable code (except the database stuff because you shouldn't have your connection uri's on github)
- a screenrecording of your code working and you explaining how you did it
- a couple sentences about how the project went

\*\* YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A 100% COMPLETE PROJECT TO SUBMIT. Please submit whatever you are able to make
