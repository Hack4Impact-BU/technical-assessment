I was able to finish my project filter paper with all the requirements. I used Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the backend. I had a lot of fun making this project. I didnâ€™t really have a lot of experience with any of the technologies used, so it was pretty difficult, but I was able to pick it up as I went, and I felt like I learned a lot more by building this project and acquiring the necessary skills step by step. I especially had quite a bit of difficulty with the backend, trying to set up MongoDB Atlas to run the backend server, but I was able to figure it out, and it was a fulfilling process.
