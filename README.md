## Summary:
The assessment was a good learning experience since I do not have much experience in React. The first big obstacle was not being able to access the API through the given endpoint. However, after some help form ChatGPT I was able to figure out it was a problem with CORS and I had to use a proxy link to access the API. I also used online resources such as YouTube to figure out how to access the data within the JSON (using the .map function), which helped me display the data in a table. Furthermore, I used some of the backend information I leanred from the JDT meetings, along with other online resources, to set up my MongoDB database and create the necessary endpoints to set and get emails from the database.
