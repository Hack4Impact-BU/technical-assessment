# Our Republic
This is submission for BU Hack4Impact's Impact Team technical assessment, a news directory that displays the *Chronicling America* database provided by the Library of Congress. You can filter the directory by state, LCCN, or both, and the table will dynamically update to reflect your filters. You can also add your name and email at the bottom of the home page to be added to the table on the community page.

The resource can be found online as a Vercel app [here](https://our-republic.vercel.app/), with the backend hosted on Heroku. My screen recording describing the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Faw1jXbb7vqugIhDP8KfhAv1zzmtP4Ea/view?usp=sharing).
